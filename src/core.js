 * <p>Espresso acts as a partial shim to ECMAScript 5, falling back
 * to native browser support when available.</p>
 *
 * <p>Espresso's goal is to provide a small library that provides
 * the basics that provide the power to developers to produce
 * sophisticated JavaScript libraries that have clear, concise,
 * and readable code, as well as a powerful consumer-facing API.</p>
 *
 * <p>This library provides the Publish-Subscribe pattern,
 * Key-Value Observing (a la Cocoa), and Ruby-like mixins.</p>
