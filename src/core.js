/** @namespace

  Espresso is a JavaScript library to be used as a
  foundation library to create JavaScript libraries.
  It also acts as a partial shim to ECMAScript 5,
  falling back to native browser support when available.

  Espresso's goal is to provide a small library that
  provides the basics that provide the power to
  developers to produce sophisticated JavaScript libraries
  that have clear, concise, and readable code, as well as
  powerful consumer-facing APIs.

  What does this mean? Less code and robust APIs!

  This library provides the Publish-Subscribe pattern,
  Key-Value Observing (a la Cocoa), and Ruby-like mixins.
